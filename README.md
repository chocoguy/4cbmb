# 4cbmb

an unofficial frontend for a certain website...
> Built this for a friend

## Update 5/31/2023
The API im using is being limited by CORS tomfoolery, meaning I can pull JSON but no static files
current workaround involves using an iframe but this is inefficent
I will begin working on a native application for IPhone. SwiftUI will be used


## Update 6/25/2023
Backend has been updated. The backend will act as a middle man of sorts and perform all 4chan requests
with this I can bypass CORS and use the API as intended. I will begin working on the native app soon

## Update 6/29/2023
MVP mostly built. need to tie loose ends and add mobile responsiveness
